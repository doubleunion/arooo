      %p Hi #{@user.name}!

      %p We'd like to offer you membership to Double Union! YAY!

      %p In order to confirm your membership, log into #{ link_to "the site", EXTERNAL_SITE_URL } ("Log in" is at top right) and complete the setup #{ link_to "on this page", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) }. This is where you'll give us your Google-friendly email address for our calendar and mailing list, and set up dues (or apply for a scholarship). (After you’ve done this, a membership coordinator will subscribe you to the mailing list and invite you to Slack. Feel free to start a thread introducing yourself and jump into conversations right away!)

      %p Please also sign up for a #{ link_to "New Member Orientation", ORIENTATION_SIGNUP_URL } so we can get you set up with your own access to the space!

      %p If you want to be listed publicly as a member (at the bottom of #{ link_to "this page", MEMBERSHIP_URL }), #{ link_to "log in", login_url } to the app and go to "Edit profile" in the right dropdown menu. There's a checkbox there marked "Show name/website/gravatar on public site?"

      %p After you fill out #{ link_to "the membership confirmation and setup form", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) }, here are some things the membership coordinators will do for you:

      %ul
        %li Give you access to the Double Union Mailing List
        %li Give you access to the Double Union Google Drive folder and Google Calendar
        %li Give you access to the Double Union Slack chat
        %li Tell you when the new member orientation meetings will be

      %p
        In case you don't have it, here's the DU address:
        %br/
        Double Union
        %br/
        1250 Missouri Street, Suite 111
        %br/
        San Francisco, CA 94107

      %p When you're a new member, you can visit when other people are already in the space (such as during events announced on the mailing list). When you get to the building: the ground floor has a glass door with a keypad to the right. You can use the keypad to dial the pound sign (#) and then our suite number (111) to call the phone in the space, and a person in the space can let you in by answering the phone. Then go inside and take the elevator up to the first floor. The space is down the hall to your left!

      %p When you attend a new member orientation, you’ll have the option to become a key member. As a key member you’d be able to enter the space even when other members are not already in the space. There are a number of responsibilities you would accept as a key member, which will be explained in the new member orientation.

      %p If you have any questions, email the membership coordinator at #{ mail_to MEMBERSHIP_EMAIL }.

      %p
        All the best,
        %br/

      %p PS: Go do #{ link_to "all the things", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) } to get your membership finalized!
