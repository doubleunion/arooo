      %p Hi #{@user.name}!

      %p We'd like to offer you membership to Double Union! YAY! There's so much to do now that you're a member :D

      %p As soon as possible, log into #{ link_to "the site", EXTERNAL_SITE_URL } ("Log in" is at top right) and confirm your membership #{ link_to "on this page", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) }. This is where you'll give us your Google Drive-friendly email address, set up dues (or apply for a scholarship), and check your subscription to the members' mailing list. (A membership coordinator will subscribe you to the mailing list soon. Feel free to start a thread introducing yourself and jump into conversations right away.)

      %p After you're done with that, check out the current applications to DU & let us know if you know any of the applicants! Only voting members vote, but everyone can (and should) comment on applications: #{ link_to "doubleunion.org", members_applications_url }. (You'll be able to sponsor applications after two weeks as a member.)

      %p If you want to be listed publicly as a member (at the bottom of #{ link_to "this page", MEMBERSHIP_URL }), #{ link_to "log in", login_url } to the app and go to "Edit profile" in the right dropdown menu. There's a checkbox there marked "Show name/website/gravatar on public site?"

      %p Things the membership coordinators will do for you:

      %ul
        %li Give you access to the Double Union Google Drive folder and Google Calendar
        %li Give you access to the DU Slack chat
        %li Remind you to fill out #{ link_to "that form", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) } & set up dues :D

      %p
        In case you don't have it, here's the DU address:
        %br/
        Double Union
        %br/
        1250 Missouri Street, Suite 111
        %br/
        San Francisco, CA 94107

      %p When you're a new member, you can visit when other people are already in the space (check the mailing list for information about this). When you get to the building: the ground floor has a glass door with a keypad to the right. You can use the keypad to dial our suite number (111) to call a person who can let you in. Then go inside and take the elevator up to the first floor. The space is down the hall to your right!

      %p If you have any questions, email the membership coordinator at #{ mail_to MEMBERSHIP_EMAIL }.

      %p
        All the best,
        %br/
        Double Union
        %br/
        @doubleunionsf
        %br/
        = link_to "www.doubleunion.org", EXTERNAL_SITE_URL

      %p PS: Go do #{ link_to "all the things", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) } to get your membership finalized!
