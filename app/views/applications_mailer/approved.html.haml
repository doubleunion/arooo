      %p Hi #{@user.name}!

      %p Votes have been cast, and we'd like to offer you membership to Double Union! YAY! There's so much to do now that you're a member :D

      %p As soon as possible, log into #{ link_to "the site", "http://www.doubleunion.org/" } ("Log in" is at top right) and confirm your membership #{ link_to "on this page", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) }. This is where you'll give us your Google Docs-friendly email address, set up dues, and check your subscription to the members' mailing list. (A membership coordinator will subscribe you to the mailing list soon. Feel free to start a thread introducing yourself and jump into conversations right away.)

      %p After you're done with that, check out the current applications to DU & let us know if you know any of the applicants! Only voting members vote, but everyone can (and should) comment on applications: #{ link_to "doubleunion.org", members_applications_url }. (You'll be able to sponsor applications after two weeks as a member.)

      %p You can also check out our #{ link_to "wonderful wiki", "http://wiki.doubleunion.org/"} and e-mail wiki@doubleunion.org for access.

      %p If you want to be listed publicly as a member (at the bottom of #{ link_to "this page", "http://www.doubleunion.org/membership" }), #{ link_to "log in", "http://www.doubleunion.org/login" } to the app and go to "Edit profile" in the right dropdown menu. There's a checkbox there marked "Show name/website/gravatar on public site?"

      %p Things the membership coordinators will do for you:

      %ul
        %li Give you access to the Double Union Google Docs folder
        %li Give you access to the DU calendar
        %li Remind you to fill out #{ link_to "that form", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) } & set up dues :D

      %p
        In case you don't have it, here's the DU address:
        %br/
        Double Union
        %br/
        333 Valencia, Suite 445
        %br/
        SF, CA 94103

      %p We're on the fourth floor. There's an elevator on the left when you enter the lobby of 333 Valencia. If you're taking the stairs, just keep walking until you can't walk up any more. Once you get to the fourth floor lobby, head toward the right hallway. We're just past Woman, Inc.

      %p If you have any questions, email the membership coordinator at #{t('du.membership_email')}.

      %p
        All the best,
        %br/
        Double Union
        %br/
        @doubleunionsf
        %br/
        = link_to "www.doubleunion.org", "http://www.doubleunion.org"

      %p PS: Go do #{ link_to "all the things", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) } to get your membership finalized!
