      Hi, #{@user.name}!
    %p
      Thanks for getting all of your Double Union membership things set up. You now have access to the mailing list, the #{ link_to "members Google Drive folder", "https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B6a_aDP-2fOVV2FQLW5FVTZ2Mjg" } and a Google calendar called "Double Union Members". You should read through the #{ link_to "Member Handbook", "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yYXAj8rzQMiYt2xFdzm2xEOe0LCHohWNrMWzad-4mtQ/edit" } now to get a quick overview of how things work at DU.  You also now have access to the { link_to "DU chat system (Slack)", "https://doubleunion.slack.com/" }!
    %p
      If you have any questions, feel free to email the membership coordinator at #{ mail_to MEMBERSHIP_EMAIL }.
    %p
      See you at a members' meeting soon!

    %p
      All the best,
