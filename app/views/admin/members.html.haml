  %p Changing state on these buttons doesn't do anything except update the app. You'll still need to inform the person of the status change and add/remove permissions to things as necessary, such as:
  %ul
    %li Mailing lists
    %li Google drive folders
    %li Member's calendar
    %li Key codes / physical keys
    %li The wiki

  %p Want all the members as a big blob of json? #{ link_to "Here you go!", admin_members_path(format: :json) }
