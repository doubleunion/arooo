%p Membership dues payments are handled via Stripe, which will charge your credit or debit card on the same date each month.

%p If you need to change your dues payment, just fill in the form again and it will be updated. (If you switch your dues to a lower level, our dues system automatically pro-rates your next payments, so you may get charged a lower partial amount [or nothing] on your next scheduled dues payment date. This is ok!)

%h4#your-dues-status Your Current Dues Status

- if @subscription
  %p
    Your current Stripe subscription is
    %b
      #{number_to_currency (@subscription.plan.amount / 100)}
    per #{@subscription.plan.interval}, and your status is <b>#{@subscription.status}</b>.
- elsif current_user.is_scholarship?
  %p You are receiving a scholarship for your dues payments.
- else
  %p You don't have a Stripe subscription yet, or it may have been canceled. Please add your credit or debit card, or request a scholarship below! <3

  %p On average members give $30 / month, but please select whatever you can afford. Your dues go directly towards sustaining the space, such as paying for rent, buying supplies, and maintaining our tools.

%p Any dues paid above the base level of $10 / month can be considered a tax deductible donation when you file your taxes. For example, if you paid $20 / month for a full year you could include a $120 donation to Double Union on your taxes.
