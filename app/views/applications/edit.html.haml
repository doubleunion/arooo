%h2 Membership application

%p
  Hello! We're glad you're interested in becoming a member of Double Union. We love reading applications and look forward to meeting you if we haven't already.
  If you have any questions about the application or application process, please email our membership coordinators at #{ mail_to JOIN_EMAIL }.

%p
  You can save this application at any time before you submit it. Once
  submitted, it will only be visible to Double Union members.  No part of this
  application will ever be public.

%p
  A small tip: The paragraph questions are parsed as markdown! Here's a #{ link_to "markdown syntax cheatsheet", "https://caleorourke.gitbooks.io/redcarpet-syntax/content/cheatsheet/index.html", target: "_blank"}.
  That means that you can also just type in sentences or paragraphs and it'll look fine, too.
  You can also #{ link_to "preview your application", application_path(@user.application), target: "_blank"} before or after submitting it.

%p
  If this application looks blanker than you left it, double check that you logged in with the same service as before by logging out and trying the other one (GitHub or Google).

            In this question, we're just curious to get an overall sense of your story. We don't evaluate applications based
            on how accomplished or successful a person is. Some sentences or a paragraph would be great; for all of these questions,
            we love getting to read some detail but don't want to burden you with writing a huge essay.
            Feel free to include extra URLs if you like. It's helpful to include a little extra info here if you don't have a
            public online presence (such as Twitter or a website).

          %p.small
            We ask this question since we'd like to know if you have interests and goals related to joining DU that are
            approximately compatible with the general broad goals of DU (and what it can offer to members).

      %tr
        %td
          = profile_fields.label :reasons, 'Tell us about your feminism!'
          %p.small
            We ask this because we care about DU being an intersectional feminist space, and it's important to us
            that new members care about this too; we expect members to identify as feminist in some way. To help us
            understand your perspective, we'd like to hear about your thoughts around your own feminism. It's ok if you
            don't have a formal/academic way of talking about this! You may also find it helpful to look at our
            #{ link_to "base assumptions", BASE_ASSUMPTIONS_URL, target: "_blank" } since they help explain DU's shared values.
          %p.small Required — 2000 character maximum.

          %p.small
            We're curious! We sometimes look at these answers to help us figure out what kinds of workshops and events
            to hold during the membership application round (or as public events in general). This doesn't have to be
            long.
