%h2 Membership application

%p
  Hello! We're glad you're interested in becoming a member of Double Union. We love reading applications and look forward to meeting you if we haven't already.

%p
  If you have any questions about the application or application process, please email our membership coordinators at #{ mail_to JOIN_EMAIL }.

%p
  If this application looks blanker than you left it, double check that you logged in with the same service as before by logging out and trying the other one (GitHub or Google).

%p
  You can save this application at any time before you submit it. Once
  submitted, it will only be visible to Double Union members.  No part of this
  application will ever be public.

          %small In this question, we're just curious to get an overall sense of your story. We don't evaluate applications based on how accomplished or successful a person is. Some sentences or a paragraph would be great; for all of these questions, we love getting to read some detail but don't want to burden you with writing a huge essay. Feel free to include extra URLs if you like. If you don't have a public online presence (such as Twitter or a website), which is fine, it can help us if you add a little extra here. (2000 character maximum.)

      %tr
        %td
          = profile_fields.label :reasons, 'Why are you interested in joining Double Union?'
          %small We ask this question since we'd like to know if you have interests and goals related to joining DU that are approximately compatible with the general broad goals of DU (and what it can offer to members). (2000 character maximum.)
        %td= profile_fields.text_area :reasons, rows: 10

      %tr
        %td
          = profile_fields.label :reasons, 'Tell us about your feminism!'
          %small We ask this because we care about DU being an intersectional feminist space, and it's important to us that new members care about this too; we expect members to identify as feminist in some way. To help us understand your perspective, we'd like to hear about your thoughts around your own feminism. It's ok if you don't have a formal/academic way of talking about this! You may also find it helpful to look at our #{ link_to "base assumptions", BASE_ASSUMPTIONS_URL } since they help explain DU's shared values. (2000 character maximum.)

      %tr
        %td
          = profile_fields.label :projects, 'What would you like to work on in the space?'
          %small We're curious! We sometimes look at these answers to help us figure out what kinds of workshops and events to hold during the membership application round (or as public events in general). This doesn't have to be long. (2000 character maximum)
