%p Great news! #{@user.name} (cc'd) is now a key member.

%p
  #{@user.name}, to finalize your key membership you must attend a Key Member Orientation or a New Member Orientation (if you haven't already).
  %br/
  At the orientation we:

%ul 
  %li Show you how to unlock and lock up the space
  %li Review the responsibilities of being a key member

%p 
  If there are no key member orientations or new member orientations currently scheduled, please reply-all to this email to schedule one with the Membership Coordinators (please include a few times/dates that would work well for you!). You may optionally attend key member orientation over video chat (if you've already done a new member orientation), but in person is best so that you can see how everything works.

  Wooooooo,
