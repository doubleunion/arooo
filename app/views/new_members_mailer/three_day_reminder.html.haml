  Hi #{@user.name}!

%p We are so excited for you to be a member of Double Union. Before things are official, though, we need you to set up your dues and tell us a Google-friendly email address we should use for your access. As soon as possible, log into #{ link_to "the site", EXTERNAL_SITE_URL } ("Log in" is at top right) and confirm your membership #{ link_to "on this page", members_user_setup_url(@user.id) }.

%p (If you've already submitted a request for a dues scholarship and filled out your Google-friendly email address, you can ignore this email - it'll resolve itself when your request is approved.)

%p
  If you have any questions, email the membership coordinators at #{ mail_to MEMBERSHIP_EMAIL }!

%p
  All the best,
